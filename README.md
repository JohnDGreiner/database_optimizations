# Database Optimizations

## Description

Given an existing application which generates a report from a large data set, improve the efficiency of the report using database optimization methods.

## Objectives

* First db:seed - 1924 seconds
* First index page load - 3.3 mins
* Index migrations took 5.2 seconds
* Second index page load was 7 seconds
* After modifying controller page loads in 4.4 seconds
* Second db seed took 9691.683501 seconds.

Database
* 569.5 MB on disk
* 1.47 GB on disk
* I think the size of this database is small compared to what I will work on in my career.
